# MyStore

This project is a full single page e-commerce application created using Angular. Users have the ability to browse a list of products, view details on individual products, adjust quantities and add them to a cart. On the cart page, added products can be viewed along with the total cost of all the products combined. Alerts are shown when a product is added to the cart and when a product's quantity reaches '0' and is removed from the cart. Once the form is submitted with validated information, a success page is shown which ultimately completes the checkout process.
